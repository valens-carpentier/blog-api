# Blog API

A RESTful API backend that powers two separate frontend applications: a public blog for readers and a private admin interface for content management.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the power of a decoupled architecture by providing:
- A secure API backend for blog management
- A public frontend for readers to view and comment on posts
- A private admin frontend for content creation and management
